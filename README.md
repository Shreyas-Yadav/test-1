Dr. Kalam dedicated Ignited Minds to an intermediate school child he met at a school. While talking to students, a question came up: "Who is our enemy?" Kalam recalled that many answers were given, but the one which all agreed upon came from student Snehal Thakkar: "Our enemy is poverty." This small book of 205 pages examines attitudes afflicting Indians today and presents prescriptions for the rapid growth of India to enable the country to emerge as a developed country. Kalam addressed the book to the young citizens of India. The book saw increased demand following the death of Dr. Abdul Kalam in 2015.[3]
